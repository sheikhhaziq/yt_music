# Dart YouTube Music API

This package allows you to interact with YouTube Music data in Dart. You can search for songs, albums, artists, and playlists, retrieve detailed information, and get suggestions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can install the package in your Dart project using the following methods:

#### 1. Using `flutter pub` (for Flutter projects)

```bash
flutter pub add dart_ytmusic_api
```

#### 2. Using `dart pub` (for general Dart projects)

```bash

```

#### 3. Modifying `pubspec.yaml`

Add the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file under the `dependencies` section:

```yaml

Then, run `flutter pub get` (for Flutter projects) or `dart pub get` (for general Dart projects) to install the package.

### Usage
